# Password Generator
## What is it? 
It's a website with a button that when clicked, generates two random passwords in the two empty boxes. 
It's also the fourth project, and the third solo project, part of the Scrimba Course, that I uploaded to Github. This project is part of module 3, where they teach you how to use Javascript.
## What did I use?
I used HTML, CSS and Javascript
## What did I learn?
 ### Things explained in the section that this project was
  - **arrays:** what they are and the basic methods that you can use in them
    - `array.push()` `array.pop()` `array.shift()` `array.unshift()`
  - **objects:** what they are and how to declare them
  - **booleans:** what they are and how to declare them
  - **if else statements:** how and when to use them
  - **comparison operators** that return boolean values only used, for now, in if statements
    - `<=` `===` `<`
  - **conditional operators** to make more complex logical operations
    - `&&` `||`
  - **Math object:**  used to make random numbers, or remove decimals
    - `Math.random()` `Math.floor()`
  - **return statement** in functions, to return values outside of the functions
### Why is the website too simple if I know how to make it better?
I want to only use the things that I learned in the Scrimba course, before doing the project and after I complete the course, return to the projects individually and improve them with all the things necessary for a correct website. I don't want to modify the website too much; and make it difficult to improve or fix after.
